Term Project – Milestone TwoAfter Innovative EDucation (IED) demonstrated the
 prototype of UVSim to Utah Valley University (UVU), a validation and
 verification meeting was held involving all the stakeholders.
 The followings are the meeting outcomes.

 (1) (10 points) The prototype of UVSim meets the basic needs of UVU. UVU
 will continue the contract with IED. However, UVU concerns the quality of
 UVSim, and worries about some of the key quality issues may be ignored during
 the fast prototyping. UVU suggested IED to through away the current prototype
 and start a new design which can accommodate future functional expansion of
 UVSim. IED agree to provide a one page justification (single space and 12 pt
 font size) to justify whether to through away or keep the current prototype.

 (2) (20 points) IED will build Software Requirement Specification (SRS) include
 Functional Requirement (FR) and Non-Functional Requirement (user friendly)
 by using Delphi Method. The Delphi process is listed as follow.

 Step 1: Every team member list their own 15 FRs. Discussion is not allowed
 between team members. There will be 4 separate documents. This is the first
 iteration, and need to be in the submission.

 Step 2: Every team member send the FR to the team leader, and don't put
 your name on the document.

 Step 3: Team leader assemble the four documents
 to two. Send each document to sub-group of two students. Each sub-group
 discuss, revise, and modify their document.

 Step 4: Once the sub-group
 agreed upon their FR, submit to the leader. This is the second iteration.
 Your team should have six (4+2+1) documents now. Again, don't write names
 on the documents. You need to include these two documents in your submission
 as well.

 Step 5: Group meeting, assemble the two documents into one. Discuss, modify,
 and revise to reach the final version. Include the final version in your
 submission as baseline.
 Example of functional requirements Requirement
 Classification The system should allow employees to update their own
 information, including addresses, phone numbers, emergency contact
 information, beneficiary information, paycheck deductions, office location,
 office phone number, and office e-mail address.
 FunctionalThe system should be accessible over the web and be secure.
 Non-functionalThe system must provide a searchable online company directory.


 (3) (20 points) IED will design Class Diagram as baseline. The Class Diagram
 should follow the following requirements.
 • Interfaces, Abstract Classes, and Base Class are allowed.
 • Apply Model View Controller (MVC) and Façade software design patterns. Use
 dash line box to circulate the patterns. You need to label the pattern name.
 • You need to strictly follow “high cohesion and loos coupling” design
 guideline as follow,
  No class can has more than 5 coupling with other classes. (hint: coupling
 types include Content, Common, External, Control, Stamp, and Data couplings)
  No class can has more than 5 attributes (hint: design data structure
 if needed).
  No class can has more than 10 methods. Constructor and accessors are not
 counted. (hint: cohesion types include Functional, Sequential, Communication,
 Procedural, Temporal, or Logical cohesion.)


 (4) (20 points) UVU require the following increment and enhancement to UVSim
 simulator. Provide user friendly GUI for UVSim. You will need to submit a
 wireframe diagram in requirement document. Also, you will need to
 quantitatively define user friendly in SRS.


 (5) (10 points) Provide library documentation for each designed class.
 The documentation include
 Description of the purpose of the class
 Description of each of the arguments
 Precondition of each of the class
 Post condition of each of the class


 (6) (5 points) Decompose Milestone to backlogs and sprints.


 (7) (5 points) Submit Meeting logs and contribution form with signatures.


 (8) (10 points) Submit Readme.
